Some professional information you can find on my [Linkedin](www.linkedin.com/in/markvanwijk) profile. Information on my hobbies I tend to share on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/mark.j.van.wijk), most of that is limited to my facebook connections. These connections tend to be people I met in real life. You can also experience some of my interests from my [twitter](https://twitter.com/mjvw68) account.
